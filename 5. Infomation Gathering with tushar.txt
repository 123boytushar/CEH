Foot-Printing Methodology

	1. Foot-printing through Search Engine --> Google, Yahoo, Bing etc
	2. Foot-printing through Advanced google Hacking Techniques -->  Using of Google Dorking methods ex - intitle:, filetype:, inurl:
1)Directory
site vulnweb.com intitle:index.of = .com,.edu,.org
2).Config Files
site:vulnweb.com ext:xml | ext:conf | ext:cnf | ext:reg❘ ext:inf | ext:rdp | ext:cfg | ext.txt | ext:ora | ext:ini = .com,.edu,.org
3)Login Page Find
site:vulnweb.com inurl:login | inurl:signin intitle:Login | intitle: signin | inurl:auth = facebook.com,yahoo.com
4)Document Exposure
site:vulnweb.com ext:doc | ext:docx | ext:odtext:pdf | ext:rtf | ext:sxw | ext:psw| ext:ppt | ext:pptx | ext:pps | ext:csv = facebook.com
5)Github Dorking
https://github.com/search?q=%22 *.vulnweb.com%22&type=repositories = yahoo.com
6)Waybackurls
https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=*.yahoo.com/*&output=text&fl=original&collapse=urlkey = asana.com,hackerone.com
7)Gist Github
https://gist.github.com/search?q=*.%22vulnweb.com%22 = yahoo.com
8)Amazon aws
site:.s3.amazonaws.com "vulnweb.com" = yahoo.com,facebook.com
9).php Waybackurl
https://web.archive.org/cdx/search?url=vulnweb.com/&matchType=domain&collapse=urlkey&outp ut=text&fl=original&filter=urlkey:.*php&limit=100000 = hackerone.com
10).git folders
inurl:"/.git "vulnweb.com -github = yahoo.com,facebook.com
11)find country site
inurl:.php?id= site:.pk

           site: etc https://securitytrails.com/blog/google-hacking-techniques
	3. Foot-printing through Social Networking platforms --> Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin etc
	4. Foot-printing through Websites  --> their own sites
	5. Foot-printing through Email --> whatever email id they are using or provided(ultratools)Hunter.io
	6. Foot-printing through WHOIS --> you can use tools also or use website   i.e =  HYPERLINK "https://who.is/"https://who.is/
	7. Foot-printing through DNS  --> getting information about domain by DNSdumpster.com
	8. Foot-printing through Network  -->  all information about network such as ip address, ports, info about network map.
	9. Foot-printing through Social Engineering --> getting information from people by manipulating them.
	10. Foot-Printing through Competitive intelligence --> Competitive intelligence gathering is the process of gathering 
        information about the competitors from resources such as the Internet.
	Eg: company website, search engine, internet, online databases, press releases, annual
	+reports, trade journals
