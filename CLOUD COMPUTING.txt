                                                                      Cloud Computing

What is cloud computing :
Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the web instead of your computer's hard drive.

Characteristics of Cloud Computing :
Increase users flexibility
Cost reduction
Device and location independence
Automated management
Virtualization

Types of Cloud Computing Services
Infrastructure-as-a-service(IaaS): It will give complete empty infrastructure, you can customize in your own specific way
	○ Used by system admin
	○ You can choose your own OS
	○ Provides infrastructure
	○ Provides IP Address related to it
	○ Virtual machine and storage
Platform-as-a-service(PaaS): It will give you a runtime environment by which you can develop or deploy the application with tools which is also provided by vendors.
	○ Used by developer
	○ Runtime environment
	○ No need to purchase expensive hardware or software while making or developing
	○ Platform where you can work
	
Software-as-a-service(SaaS): It will give you a software interface to you for processing all this stuff and the backend process will be managed by vendors
	○ Used by end-users or client users
	○ Servers and resources are managed by the vendors
	○ No need to install software, you will require only a good internet connection
	○ Platform independency doesn't require any specific platform
	○ No access to all the resources

Cloud Deployment Models
Cloud deployment model selection is based on the enterprise requirements.

Public cloud: Services are rendered over a network that is open to public
	○ Less cost
	○ Globally available
	○ Less customization
		 
Private cloud: Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization
	○ High cost
	○ Locally available
	○ High customization
		 
Hybrid cloud: Composition of public and private cloud
	○ Cost efficient
	○ High customization
	○ Less cost

What is virtualization?
It is the ability to run multiple operating systems on a simple physical system and share the underlying resources such as a server, a storage device,e or a network
Benefits of Virtualization :
        ○ Increase business continuity
	○ Reduce setup cost
	○ Facilities better backup and data protections
	 		 
Security concerns of Cloud
	1. Third-party handling data
	2. Challenging cyber attacks
	3. Insider threats
	4. Government intrusion
	5. Lack of support
	 
Cloud Computing attacks
	○ Service hijacking using Social Engineering attacks
	○ Service hijacking using network sniffing
	○ Session hijacking using an XSS attack
	○ Domain name system attack
	○ SQL injection attacks
	○ DOS and DDoS
	○ Man in the cloud attack
        ○ Insecure encryption and many more

# OWASP Cloud-Native Application Security Top 10
CNAS-1: Insecure cloud, container or orchestration configuration
Examples:
Publicly open cloud storage buckets
Imrpoper permissions set on cloud storage buckets
Container runs as root
Container shares resources with the host (network interface, etc.)
Insecure Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration

CNAS-2: Injection flaws (app layer, cloud events, cloud services)
Examples:
SQL injection
XXE
NoSQL injection
OS command injection
Serverless event data injection

CNAS-3: Improper authentication & authorization
Examples:
Unauthenticated API access on a microservice
Over-permissive cloud IAM role
Lack of orchestrator node trust rules (e.g. unauthorized hosts joining the cluster)
Unauthenticated orchestrator console access
Unauthrized or overly-permissive orchestrator access

CNAS-4: CI/CD pipeline & software supply chain flaws
Examples:
Insufficient authentication on CI/CD pipeline systems
Use of untrusted images
Use of stale images
Insecure communication channels to registries
Overly-permissive registry access
Using a single environment to run CI/CD tasks for projects requiring different levels of security

CNAS-5: Insecure secrets storage
Examples:
Orchestrator secrets stored unencrypted
API keys or passwords stored unencrypted inside containers
Hardcoded application secrets
Poorly encrypted secrets (e.g. use of obsolete encryption methods, use of encoding instead of encryption, etc.)
Mounting of storage containing sensitive information

CNAS-6: Over-permissive or insecure network policies
Examples:
Over-permissive pod to pod communication allowed
Internal microservices exposed to the public Internet
No network segmentation defined
End-to-end communications not encrypted
Network traffic to unknown or potentially malicious domains not monitored and blocked

CNAS-7: Using components with known vulnerabilities
Examples:
Vulnerable 3rd party open source packages
Vulnerable versions of application components
Use of known vulnerable container images

CNAS-8: Improper assets management
Examples:
Undocumented microservices & APIs
Obsolete & unmanaged cloud resources

CNAS-9: Inadequate ‘compute’ resource quota limits
Examples:
Resource-unbound containers
Over-permissive request quota set on APIs

CNAS-10: Ineffective logging & monitoring (e.g. runtime activity)
Examples:
No container or host process activity monitoring
No network communications monitoring among microservices
No resource consumption monitoring to ensure availability of critical resources
Lack of monitoring on orchestration configuration propagation and stale configs
