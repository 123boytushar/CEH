# Basic
	**Social engineering is an act of stealing information from humans. Its a mind manipulation technique.**
	- No interaction with target system or network
	- Non-technical attack
	- Convincing the target to reveal information
	- One of the major vulnerability which leads to this type of attack is **Trust**.
	- User trust in another user and does not secure their credentials from them.
	- Employees are uneducated at organizations, so this is a major vulnerability.
	- Lack of security policies and privacy are also vulnerable.
============================================================================================================================================================
# Phases in Social Engineering
	**Research**
		- Collection of information from the target organization
		- Collected by dumpster diving, scanning, search on the internet, ...
	**Select target**
		- Select the target among other employees
		- A frustrated target is more preferred
	**Relationship**
		- Create relationship with the target
		- Earn the trust
	**Exploit**
		- Collecting sensitive information such as usernames, password, etc...
============================================================================================================================================================
# Types of Social Engineering - SE Attacks
	#Human-based Social Engineering - SE**
			One-to-one interaction with the target. Earn the trust to gather sensitive information from the target.
		***Eavesdropping and Shoulder Surfing***
			- Eavesdropping is a technique in which attacker is revealed information by listening to the conversation.
			- Reading or accessing any source of information without being notified.
			- Shoulder Surfing is a method of gathering information by standing behind the target.
		***Dumpster Diving*** --->
			- Looking for treasure in trash.
		***Piggybacking and Tailgating***
			- Piggyback is a technique in which attacker waits for an authorized person to gain entry in a restricted area.
			- Tailgating is a technique in which attacker gains access to the restricted area by following the authorized person.

	#Computer-based Social Engineering**
		***Phishing***
			attacker make fake page like facebook ,instagram and etc. and when any people go to the link and try to log in they will redirected to the original page of website and we get the log in details like username ,email and password.
		***Spear Phishing*** --->
			Similar as phishing but in this we can target our friends and relatives through the call, msg and email and convince them to open link and log in with the like when they try to log in we get the log in credentials. (phishing with already known people like friends ,relatives)

	#Mobile-based Social Engineering**
		***Publishing Malicious Apps***
			These applications are normally a similar copy of a popular application.
		***Repackaging Legitimate Apps***
			Repack a legitimate app with a malware.
============================================================================================================================================================
	**Insider Attack**  --->
		Social Engineering is not all about a third person gathering information, it may be an insider with privileges.

	**Impersonation on Social Network Sites**
		***Social Engineering Through Impersonation on Social Network Sites***
			- Attacker gathers personal information of a target from different sources mostly from social network sites such as full name, date of birth, email address, residential address, etc.
			- After gathering the information, the attacker create an account that is exactly the same. Then introduced to friends, group joined by 
			  the target to get updates or convince the target's friends to reveal information.
		
	**Identity Theft**
		- Stealing the identification information of someone
		- Popularly used for frauds
		- Prove the fake identity to take advantage of it

# Countermeasures
	**Secure sensitive data**
		Store Data at rest in a secure manner (Use Encryption ). Don't share Sensitive info/Documents with everyone.
	**Physical security**
	 	Who has access to Physical records (Data), who has access to sensitive areas (Server room, Admin block, Data Centres), and how you ensure that Physical security.
	**Least privileges**
		Assign least Privileges to Employees/User.(Low Permissions)
	**Strong policies**
		Password Policies, Access Policies, Device Controls, etc.
	**Training**
		Train your Employees for popular and new S.E Attacks.
